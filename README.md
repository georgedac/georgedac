- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m George Daccache. I am currently a software engineer at Composable Analytics, and before that I was an Applied Math and History double major at Brown University.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in front-end web development and scientific computing, although I also use T-SQL regularly for my job. You will find samples of projects
I have authored over the years in my repo.
- If you are an employer or academic institution, feel free to contact me about my prior or current work on LinkedIn or otherwise.
